This ship adds users in Hull in a Mailchimp List and creates Segments that match those in Hull. It also fetches the open stats for each user.

# Setup

- Click the "Continue with Mailchimp" button, follow the instructions to add your users to Mailchimp.
- The Ship does NOT import users from Mailchimp in Hull. Sync is one-way for now.
- Optionally, only send a specific set of Users to Mailchimp with the `Filtered Segments` field
